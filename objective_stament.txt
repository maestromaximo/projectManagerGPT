AI-Driven Project Management Tool: Technical Documentation
Overview
This document outlines the architecture and technical details for developing an AI-driven Project Management Tool, designed to assist individual developers in managing software development projects. The tool integrates GPT-4 for intelligent task management and pathway generation.

System Architecture
High-Level Architecture
Frontend: Interactive user interface for project management.
Backend: Server handling business logic, database interactions, and API integrations.
AI Module: GPT-4 integration for intelligent decision-making and suggestions.
Database: Stores project data, user profiles, and system logs.
Detailed Component Breakdown
Frontend:

Technologies: ReactJS, Redux for state management.
Features: Dashboard, project creation/editing interface, task display, notifications.
Backend:

Language: Python with Flask/Django framework.
RESTful API Endpoints: Handling CRUD operations for projects, tasks, and user data.
Integration with GPT-4 API: For intelligent processing and suggestions.
AI Module:

Interaction with OpenAI's GPT-4 API.
Custom Python scripts for processing AI suggestions and integrating them with project data.
Database:

Technology: PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
Schema Design: User tables, project tables, task tables, logs.
Functional Components
Project Creation and Management
